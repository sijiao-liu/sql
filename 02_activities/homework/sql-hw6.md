**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

## Privacy and Privacy Policies
Relational databases often store sensitive personal information, making privacy a critical concern. SQL queries can access vast amounts of data, and without stringent privacy policies, this data can be misused. Organizations must implement robust privacy policies to protect individuals’ data from unauthorized access and breaches. This includes ensuring that data is anonymized where possible and that users are informed about how their data is being used and stored. 

_For example, I managed employees’ personal learning and training data, as well as information related to excess leave payment, paid leave, and leave without pay. When distributing this data to the management team, I included a reminder that only employees’ managers were authorized to review it if further sharing was necessary._


## Security and Appropriate Access to Data
Security is paramount in database management. SQL databases must be protected against SQL injection attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches. Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized personnel can access specific data, reducing the risk of data misuse. Regular security audits and updates are essential to maintain the integrity and security of the database.

_For example, I assisted a colleague in granting database access to employees. My responsibilities included specifying the appropriate access levels and the types of data employees could access. Additionally, I ensured that employees’ managers approved and signed off on their access applications._


## Database Design and Perception
The design of a database can influence how data is perceived and interpreted. For example, the way data is categorized and labeled can introduce biases. If a database design reflects certain biases, it can perpetuate stereotypes and misinformation. Therefore, it’s crucial to design databases that are neutral and inclusive, ensuring that data is represented accurately and fairly.

_For example, I used to create Excel tools to help management collect data on employees’ learning activities. When designing these tools, I had to consider the necessary restrictions to ensure consistent data formatting._


## Labour Rights for Data Entry
Data entry is often a labor-intensive task that can be undervalued. Workers involved in data entry should be provided with fair wages, safe working conditions, and opportunities for skill development. Ethical considerations also include ensuring that data entry jobs are not outsourced to regions with poor labor practices, which can exploit workers.


## Bias in Data Entry
Bias can be introduced at various stages of data entry, from the selection of data to the way it is recorded. This can lead to skewed data that does not accurately represent reality. It’s important to implement checks and balances to minimize bias, such as diverse teams for data entry and regular reviews of data for accuracy and fairness.

_For example, some of my friends work as HR assistants, and part of their responsibilities includes entering employees’ personal data into our database. They must follow guidelines on what and where to enter the information._
